## 0. Cinematic Scroll Personal Brand

**Best for:** AI engineers, AI creators, founders, consultants, high-end personal brands, and users who provide premium landing-page references such as WISA.

**Vibe:** dark, cinematic, minimal, expensive, editorial, restrained.

**Color:** pure black or near-black base, white primary text, translucent white secondary text, very limited accent color.

**Typography:** Manrope or refined geometric sans for large headlines, JetBrains Mono or similar mono for nav labels, metadata, and buttons.

**Hero:** fixed full-screen video or cinematic abstract background, 90% width container, 12-column grid, name and positioning anchored bottom-left, concise intro top/right, glass CTA bottom-right.

**Sections:** scroll-reveal statement, 3-column proof/link grid, glassmorphism footer as the main platform/project entry hub.

**Motion:** scroll-driven video scrub, word-by-word reveal, header slide-out, nav text fly-up, CTA arrow fly-out/fly-in, subtle viewport reveals.

**Risks:** can become too empty if content is weak. Keep copy sharp, links obvious, and footer useful.

**Hard rule:** if the user provides a concrete cinematic template or says to strictly follow a reference, use this preset and preserve the reference structure. Do not propose alternative visual directions first.

See [CINEMATIC_SCROLL_TEMPLATE.md](CINEMATIC_SCROLL_TEMPLATE.md).

## 0B. Soft Product Video Hero

**Best for:** users who provide polished SaaS/product hero references, personal product creators, AI tool builders, and link-hub pages that need a soft premium product feel without looking like a resume.

**Vibe:** soft, clean, premium, product-led, friendly, secure, high-clarity.

**Color:** warm neutral or muted video background, dark blue-gray text, one strong violet/brand CTA accent, light pill login surfaces.

**Typography:** bold characterful display heading paired with Inter-like readable body. Icons can be embedded inline in headlines when they reinforce the concept.

**Hero:** full-viewport looping background video, minimal centered headline, inline semantic icons, concise subtext, strong pill CTA, and a simple floating nav with primary/secondary account actions.

**Sections:** use sparingly; this style works best as a landing hero, digital card, product entry page, or compact personal tool intro.

**Motion:** Framer Motion fade-up system, subtle button scale/brightness, mobile sheet slide-in, backdrop blur, and staggered mobile nav links.

**Risks:** can become generic SaaS. Keep the person/product identity specific, avoid adding many sections, and preserve the soft video atmosphere.

**Reference pattern:** password-manager landing hero with Helvetica Now Display Bold, Inter, full-screen video, geometric SVG logo, pill nav CTAs, inline Lucide headline icons, and mobile slide-in sheet.

## 0C. TOONHUB Figurine Carousel

**Best for:** playful creators, toy / IP artists, character designers, product makers, visual storytellers, and users who provide a saturated character-figurine carousel reference.

**Vibe:** bold, playful, collectible, toy-store premium, kinetic, pop-cultural, tactile.

**Color:** one saturated background per character or project, with a lighter panel color behind the subject. Palette transitions should feel decisive and candy-like, not generic gradients.

**Typography:** Anton-style condensed display type for giant ghost words and brand marks, paired with Inter-like readable body text.

**Hero:** full-viewport character carousel, oversized ghost display text such as `3D SHAPE`, center figurine, left/right/back supporting figurines, grain overlay, brand label, bottom-left copy, prev/next buttons, and a bottom-right discovery CTA.

**Sections:** best used as a hero-first page. Follow-up sections can map each character/project to story, process, product drop, gallery, or contact / order CTA.

**Motion:** locked prev/next carousel with role-based image transforms, 650ms transition discipline, background and panel color transitions, subtle center floating, and `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback.

**Risks:** image quality drives the result. Use user-provided or clearly authorized character/figurine images; do not invent inaccessible Figma image URLs. Avoid using it for serious résumé pages unless the user explicitly wants a playful collectible identity.

**Reference pattern:** TOONHUB character-figurine carousel: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind, lucide-react arrows, Anton + Inter, saturated background states, SVG fractalNoise grain, role-derived carousel positions, and exact 650ms navigation lock.

## 0D. Clean Developer Homepage

**Best for:** frontend developers, indie hackers, open-source authors, technical bloggers, photographers-with-code, and users who provide passer-by.com-style clean personal homepage references.

**Vibe:** clean, friendly, light, developer-first, calm, approachable, real personal website rather than product landing page.

**Color:** off-white or very pale blue base, soft blue section wash, charcoal/gray text, one decisive blue CTA accent, light gray borders.

**Typography:** readable sans with optional handwritten/logo accent. Avoid over-stylizing; hierarchy comes from spacing, weight, and concise labels.

**Hero:** compact top navigation, small personal logo/wordmark, centered intro copy, highlighted role keyword, avatar or sketch portrait card on one side, location pill, two CTAs such as contact and projects, and a soft wave/gradient transition into the next section.

**Sections:** About split with visual block + concise summary, GitHub/open-source CTA band, project grid with simple hover overlays, writing / photography / message links, clean footer.

**Motion:** gentle fade-up, hover overlay on project cards, subtle background/wave movement. No heavy 3D, no scattered particles.

**Risks:** can look too plain if typography and spacing are weak. Use a continuous page shell, soft transitions, and a strong project grid so it feels like a real homepage, not stacked blocks.

**Reference pattern:** Passer-by developer homepage: light personal developer site with logo nav, centered identity hero, sketch/avatar visual, location pill, wave divider, About module, GitHub CTA, and project cards.

## 0E. Orbis NFT Space Landing

**Best for:** creator NFT drops, collectible/IP projects, digital object portfolios, artist project launches, and users who explicitly provide the `Orbis.Nft` dark space landing prompt.

**Vibe:** dark space, cinematic, collectible, liquid glass, high-contrast, poster-like.

**Color:** `#010828` deep navy base, `#EFF4FF` cream text, `#6FFF00` neon script accents, with one restrained purple gradient only for collection card action buttons.

**Typography:** Anton for headings, logo, navigation, and CTA display text; Condiment for cursive accent overlays; system monospace for uppercase descriptions, labels, and rarity metadata.

**Hero:** full-viewport video with clipped rounded bottom corners, centered max-width container, liquid-glass nav, oversized Anton uppercase title, neon Condiment `Nft collection` accent, and separate desktop/mobile social icon placement.

**Sections:** four-part landing sequence: video hero, video intro/about, solid-navy collection grid with video cards, and final video CTA.

**Motion:** looping muted videos, hover glass states, subtle social button transitions, optional reveal animations that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Risks:** this is not a default personal resume style. Use only for user-provided or authorized project/collectible references, and do not invent rarity scores, blockchain claims, social links, texture assets, or video URLs.

**Reference pattern:** `templates/orbis-nft/README.md` records the full prompt template, including CloudFront video slots, liquid-glass CSS, texture overlay, responsive sizing, and adaptation rules.

## 1. 3D Tech Portfolio

**Sections:** bento highlights, capability-based skills, 3D project cards, technical timeline.

**Sections:** content cards, social proof, project/story cards, contact CTA.

**Vibe:** cute, pixel, sticker-like, game UI, warm.
