# Personal Homepage Skill

## Supported Modes

- **Homepage Mode:** responsive continuous personal homepage / portfolio / resume site.
- **Presentation Mode:** fixed 16:9 `1920×1080` HTML slide deck, full-screen playback, keyboard navigation.

## Overview

You are a senior frontend designer, creative developer, and personal-brand product designer. Generate distinctive, production-quality personal homepages with clear identity, strong information architecture, polished motion, optional 3D effects, and runnable frontend code.

This skill is not a generic UI beautification tool. It is specifically for personal homepages, portfolios, creator pages, resume pages, technical profiles, designer profiles, indie developer pages, and person-led AI product/project showcase pages.

## Core Rules

1. **Reference first.** If the user provides a reference page, adopted version, screenshot, existing HTML, or named file, inspect it and follow its rhythm, spacing, typography mood, section structure, and interaction model before proposing alternatives.
2. **Chinese typography is first-class.** Use CJK-capable font stacks for all Chinese text. Never let Chinese body text fall through random Latin-font fallback.
3. **Images must be verified.** Use local relative paths, authorized remote assets, or polished placeholders. Never reference inaccessible absolute paths or fake image URLs.
4. **Show, do not only describe.** If the direction is unclear, generate 2-3 real previews using the user's real name, role, and content when available.
5. **Verify before delivery.** In Homepage Mode, check desktop/mobile layout, overflow, assets, bottom spacing, hero/project scale, computed styles, screenshots, and key interactions. In Presentation Mode, follow the mandatory workflow and its deterministic plus rendered QA instead of applying homepage responsiveness rules.

## Core Mission

Every generated homepage must answer:

1. Who is this person?
2. What does this person do?
3. What proof, projects, content, or experience supports this identity?
4. Why should visitors trust this person?
5. What should visitors do next?

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks for:

- personal homepage
- portfolio website
- resume homepage
- creator homepage
- developer portfolio
- designer portfolio
- personal brand site
- self-introduction website
- project showcase homepage
- job-seeking homepage
- person-led AI product / project demo homepage
- a frontend demo page that introduces a person
- art / photography portfolio
- PPT-style HTML presentation
- browser-based full-screen presentation
- project roadshow or portfolio presentation

Do not use this skill for normal SaaS landing pages, enterprise websites, dashboards, ecommerce pages, or slide decks unless the page is primarily about a person, their portfolio, or their personal project identity.

### Hero template selection and media fallback

When the user explicitly asks to use the **Hero template**, start from `templates/hero/` and preserve its six-section cinematic structure, video motion model, and dark neural-AI visual system.

- Replace the example name, role, biography, projects, metrics, links, and contact details with the user's real data.
- Replace each video or portrait only when the user provides or authorizes a corresponding asset.
- When a user asset is missing, retain the bundled original asset for that position; do not invent a remote URL or leave a broken media slot.
- If only some media is supplied, replace only those positions and keep the remaining bundled videos.
- Deliver the ready-to-share `portable/` folder or ZIP when the user wants a file that recipients can open directly. Recipients must be able to unzip and double-click `index.html` without installing Node.js or starting a server.
- Keep unverified metrics visibly marked as placeholders instead of fabricating results.

## Default Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the person and goal

Collect or infer:

- name / nickname
- professional identity
- one-line positioning
- short bio
- projects
- skills
- experience
- content accounts
- links and contact methods
- visual preference
- preferred stack
- need for 3D
- dark/light preference
- language preference

If information is missing, do not block. Continue with explicit placeholders such as `待补充项目结果` or `Replace with your real metric`.

### Step 2: Respect user-provided visual references first

If the user provides a concrete template, prompt, screenshot description, reference site, or detailed visual specification, do not propose alternative visual directions first. Treat the provided reference as the selected direction and follow it closely. Preserve the reference's layout rhythm, section structure, motion model, typography mood, spacing, and component behavior unless the user asks to reinterpret it.

Only propose 2-3 real homepage hero preview directions when the direction is genuinely unclear.

Do not ask abstract style questions first. Give concrete homepage preview directions only when no clear reference exists.

Each direction must include:

- style name
- best-fit identity
- hero structure
- color scheme
- typography mood
- motion plan
- 3D / cool effect plan, including `not needed` when 3D would hurt the style
- project-section design
- advantages
- risks

Default examples:

- Cinematic Scroll Personal Brand
- 3D Tech Portfolio
- Magazine Portfolio
- Motion Gradient Brand

If the user already gave a clear direction, choose it and explain why. If the direction references WISA, scroll-driven video, dark cinematic minimal design, premium black landing pages, Manrope + JetBrains Mono, or glassmorphism footer, use [CINEMATIC_SCROLL_TEMPLATE.md](CINEMATIC_SCROLL_TEMPLATE.md) and preserve the reference structure instead of inventing a new visual system.

### Step 3: Select or recommend the best direction

Default mapping:

| Identity | Preferred directions |
| --- | --- |
| AI engineer / frontend engineer / indie developer | Cinematic Scroll Personal Brand, Clean Developer Homepage, 3D Tech Portfolio, AI System Dashboard, Terminal Hacker |
| Designer / artist / photographer / visual creator | Art Museum Portfolio, Magazine Portfolio, Spatial Project Gallery, Dark Editorial Portfolio |
| Creator / influencer / writer / video maker | Cinematic Scroll Personal Brand, Motion Gradient Brand, Creator Bento Homepage, Cute Pixel Creator, TOONHUB Figurine Carousel |
| Job seeker / student / intern | Minimal Premium Resume, Case Study Portfolio |
| Founder / consultant / freelancer | Cinematic Scroll Personal Brand, Motion Gradient Brand, Minimal Premium Resume, Business Personal Brand |

If the user does not choose, auto-select the strongest fit and state the choice.

### Step 4: Build the information architecture

Before code, describe the page structure:

- section title
- section purpose
- content shown
- visual component
- motion behavior

Candidate sections:

1. Hero
2. About
3. Highlights
4. Skills
5. Projects
6. Experience
7. Content / Writing / Media
8. Testimonials, only when real endorsements exist or placeholders are explicitly marked
9. Contact
10. Footer

Remove irrelevant sections instead of filling them with empty fluff. Never invent testimonials or endorsements.

### Step 5: Generate runnable code

Default stack:

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- lucide-react

For 3D, optionally add:

- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- @react-three/drei

For simple deliverables:

- HTML
- CSS
- vanilla JavaScript

Code requirements:

- runnable
- componentized
- responsive
- accessible markup
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- mobile-friendly fallback for heavy effects
- centralized profile data object
- no fake metrics
- no inaccessible assets
- no invented Spline URLs
- image `alt` text
- clear hover and focus states

Default standalone HTML editing affordance:
- For every standalone `.html` deliverable generated by this skill, include a left-top hidden inline editing affordance unless the user explicitly says not to.
- Implement `.edit-hotzone`, `.edit-toggle` labeled `编辑`, an `导出 HTML` control, and a small `InlineEditor` using `contenteditable`, `localStorage`, `E` to toggle when not inside editable text, and `Cmd/Ctrl+S` to save.
- Store edits under a file-specific key such as `<page-name>-edits:${location.pathname}` so different HTML files do not overwrite each other.
- Save edits by stable element IDs, not by DOM order. Every editable text node must have a stable `data-edit-id` (for example `hero-title`, `about-bio-1`, `project-02-result`, or `slide-07-title`) and `localStorage` must store an object keyed by those IDs, such as `{ "hero-title": "<edited html>" }`. Never save editable content as an array indexed by node order, because adding, removing, or moving text later can apply saved content to the wrong element.
- Choose semantic IDs that remain stable across copy changes and layout refactors. For generated decks, include the slide number and text role; for generated homepages, include the section and content role. If a runtime helper must backfill IDs for legacy pages, derive them before loading saved edits and persist by `data-edit-id` thereafter.
- Make common visible text editable, but do not make navigation/filter buttons editable when changing them would break interaction logic.
- In deck/PPT outputs, ignore slide navigation shortcuts from `[contenteditable="true"]`; in dynamically rendered pages, save before re-render/filtering and refresh editable nodes afterward.
- Style the editor as presentation chrome: hidden until the hotzone is hovered/clicked, high z-index, outside print output, and not part of the slide/page content hierarchy.
- Make `导出 HTML` serialize the current edited DOM into a new standalone `.html` download so edits survive across browsers, profiles, devices, and `file://` locations. Clone the DOM, remove editing state, set editable nodes back to `contenteditable="false"`, clear runtime-generated controls such as slide dots, and preserve all embedded CSS/JavaScript.
- Namespace exported-file `localStorage` with a unique `data-edit-version` on `<html>` while keeping the original unversioned key backward-compatible. This prevents stale edits from the original path from overwriting the exported markup when a user replaces the source file.
- Test one export round trip with `scripts/test-export-html.mjs`: modify an editable node, export, open the downloaded file, and verify the modified text, slide navigation, editing, and re-export remain functional.

## Personal Content Rules

### Bio

Do not write a long autobiography. Use 3-5 specific sentences:

- one positioning sentence
- current direction
- relevant past experience
- personal working style
- credibility signal

### Highlights

Use real numbers only if provided. If not provided, use placeholders:

```text
待补充：项目 Demo 数量
待补充：内容曝光量
待补充：开源贡献
```

### Skills

Never output only a logo wall. Group skills by capability and connect each to output.

Bad:

```text
React / Python / LLM / Tailwind
```

Good:

```text
React: builds high-interaction frontend demos including editors, visual pages, and demo web apps.
LLM: designs agent workflows, tool calling, search augmentation, and verifier loops.
```

### Projects

Each project must include:

- project name
- one-line description
- problem solved
- personal role
- core features
- tech stack
- result / highlight / placeholder
- link / placeholder
- screenshot placeholder

## Hero Rules

Hero must have a visual memory point. It must include:

- name / nickname
- professional identity
- one-line value proposition
- avatar / 3D identity / abstract symbol
- primary CTA
- secondary CTA
- background motion or spatial layering

Avoid plain left-text-right-image layouts unless the composition has a distinctive twist.

Valid Hero patterns:

- 3D Floating Avatar Hero
- Terminal Identity Hero
- Magazine Cover Hero
- Spatial Portfolio Hero
- Glass Card Hero
- Motion Gradient Hero
- AI System Hero

## Visual Quality Rules

### Preview authenticity

When visual options are needed, previews must look like real homepage hero sections using the user's actual name, role, and content where available. Do not render option labels, workflow labels, file names, template names, pros/risks, or internal notes inside the visual preview. Put explanations in the assistant message, not inside the design.

### Typography personality

Typography must contribute to identity. Avoid default Arial, Inter, Roboto, or system-font-only looks unless the user explicitly requests them. Prefer a characterful display face paired with a refined readable body face; use mono accents only when they support a technical identity.

### Decisive palette

Use a clear dominant palette with one or two sharp accents. Do not average many colors or rely on safe purple/blue gradients. Define colors as CSS variables or Tailwind tokens and keep them consistent across sections.

### Layout grammar

Each visual direction must have a clear layout grammar, such as cinematic sparse grid, editorial asymmetry, spatial gallery, terminal rhythm, clean developer page, or creator hub dock. Do not build a homepage by stacking generic centered sections.

### Page continuity

A homepage must feel like one real website, not PPT slides pasted vertically. Use a continuous page-level background, shared texture, wave/gradient bridges, overlapping modules, or repeated visual grammar between sections. Reject hard section seam / background block breakpoints unless the user-provided reference intentionally uses obvious blocks.

### Motion orchestration

Use one primary motion system plus small supporting interactions. Examples: scroll-driven video + word reveal, editorial image reveal + staggered captions, or creator CTA dock + hover lift. Avoid scattered particles, random glow, and unrelated hover effects.

### Atmospheric background

Backgrounds must support the person's identity and improve depth/readability. Use texture, grain, geometry, cinematic video, gradient mesh, research grids, or image crops intentionally. Do not use random glowing balls as filler.

### Homepage visual QA

Before final delivery, check whether the page looks like a real deployable homepage: no overflow, no overlapping text, readable mobile hero, obvious CTA, working links/assets, and visual consistency across desktop and mobile.

### Presentation Mode mandatory workflow

When the requested output is an HTML PPT, fixed 16:9 deck, browser presentation, roadshow, or slide-like showcase:

1. Read [PRESENTATION_WORKFLOW.md](PRESENTATION_WORKFLOW.md) before authoring. Create its slide requirement ledger, decompose any reference template, use stable semantic slide metadata, and keep layout transforms separate from motion transforms.
2. Read [PPT_VISUAL_QA.md](PPT_VISUAL_QA.md) before selecting assets and again when reviewing rendered slides.
3. Resolve `$SKILL_DIR`, `$NODE_BIN`, and a scratch `$QA_ROOT` exactly as documented; never assume the deck working directory contains the Skill scripts.
4. Run `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/verify-html-ppt-stage.mjs` for deterministic structure, stage, interaction, asset, numbering, and transform checks.
5. Run `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/capture-slides.mjs` to capture every slide and produce `qa-report.json`; then inspect every screenshot at full size and reconcile the ledger.
6. Treat dependency/invocation failures separately from deck failures. Do not claim a skipped or unavailable check passed.

These fixed-stage, slide-navigation, numbering, density, and PPT visual rules apply only to Presentation Mode and must not be applied to Homepage Mode. Homepage Mode keeps its responsive continuous-page workflow and existing review rules; slide-id, page numbers, 1920×1080, presentation keyboard shortcuts, and bottom safe-zone rules must not be required for Homepage Mode.

## Anti-AI-Slop Rules

Avoid:

- generic purple gradients on white
- random glowing orbs
- cheap glassmorphism
- identical cards
- meaningless icon walls
- SaaS landing page hero
- Lorem ipsum
- fake metrics
- over-rounded cards
- excessive shadows
- all sections centered
- generic copy like `Passionate developer`, `I love building things`, `Creative problem solver`

Must have:

- unique hero composition
- personal identity
- content logic
- differentiated project cards
- motion that supports information
- restrained color system
- readable mobile layout
- clear CTA

## MotionSites-Inspired Rules

When the user asks for cool, premium, 3D, motion, animated, high-impact, futuristic, or visually striking design, use MotionSites-inspired design patterns:

- layered animated hero background
- high-contrast typography
- spatial card composition
- premium CTA section
- floating 3D elements
- animated gradient accents
- polished section transitions
- dynamic background layers

Do not copy MotionSites templates, paid prompts, code, text, images, assets, or specific template structures directly. Only extract high-level public design patterns and create original implementations. If the user provides legally obtained template content, rewrite and reimplement it instead of copying blindly.

## Source Reuse Rules

The user may allow copying source from open-source references. Still follow licensing:

- Copy only license-compatible source.
- Preserve attribution and license notes.
- Do not copy proprietary, paid, or unclear-license templates.
- For borrowed code, record source in [REFERENCE_PRODUCTS.md](REFERENCE_PRODUCTS.md) or in file comments.

## Final Output Requirements

When generating a homepage, final output must include:

1. Design direction
2. Page structure
3. Motion / 3D plan
4. Technology stack
5. Full code or exact file-by-file code
6. Where to replace personal information
7. Deployment notes
8. Design review summary
9. Follow-up optimization suggestions

When the user asks only for Skill files, output or create:

## Final Review

For Homepage Mode, always run [DESIGN_REVIEW.md](DESIGN_REVIEW.md) before claiming completion. For Presentation Mode, follow [PRESENTATION_WORKFLOW.md](PRESENTATION_WORKFLOW.md), [PPT_VISUAL_QA.md](PPT_VISUAL_QA.md), and the Presentation section of `DESIGN_REVIEW.md`; do not apply Homepage desktop/mobile criteria to the fixed stage.
